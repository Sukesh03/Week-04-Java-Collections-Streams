## Overview

This week introduced important tools and techniques for handling key-value data with Maps, persistent storage using files, and performing efficient data transformations using the Java Stream API.

---

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Map Interface - HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap

- Storing and retrieving key-value pairs
- Ordering and sorting maps
- Using custom key comparators

### Day 2: File Input and Output

- Reading and writing text files using `FileReader` and `FileWriter`
- Using buffered streams for efficiency

### Day 3: Serialization and Deserialization

- Saving objects to files using serialization
- Restoring objects with `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`

### Day 4: Java Streams Introduction

- Understanding streams vs. collections
- Lazy vs. eager evaluation in streams

### Day 5: Stream Operations (Filter, Map, Reduce)

- Functional interfaces in Java
- Processing collections with stream operations like filter, map, and reduce

### Day 6: Working with Files using Streams

- Reading CSV and text files with streams
- Collecting, grouping, and processing data streams

## Prerequisites

Before beginning Week 4, ensure you have:

- Core Java knowledge including collections and exception handling (Weeks 1–3)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and configured
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code
